# SuperTileMapper

This is a general Super NES Tilemap Editor. It allows you to edit VRAM, CGRAM, OAM, & PPU Registers easily.

The main goal is to be able to build background tilemaps by pasting together tiles. Eventually, a graphics drawing editor will be included as well. Another possiblity is an HDMA editor and previewer.
